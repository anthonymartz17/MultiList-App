# MultiList-App
This app was my most challenging project at the time. I had been teaching myself how code for about 3 months. In this project I was able to better understand concepts as the object constructor and instantiating an object. Throughout the struggles and headaches of building this app I was able better understand how and when to use things like an array of objects, a for each loop, as well as the splice method and its three parameters. Finally, I was also able to put in practice having my JavaScript files separate from the html.
