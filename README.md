# MultiList-App
This app was my most challenging project at the time. I had been teaching myself how to code for about 3 months when I built it. In this project, I was able to better understand concepts such as the object constructor and instantiating an object. Throughout the struggles and headaches of building this app I was able to better understand how and when to use things like css variables, flexbox, array of objects, for each loops, as well as the splice method and its three parameters. Finally, I was also able to put in practice having my JavaScript files separate from the html. I felt really proud of myself for having coded this app on my own.
